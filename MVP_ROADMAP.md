üî∑ MVP Roadmap: Cross-Exchange Arbitrage
Phase 1: Foundations (Environment & Setup)

Pick 2‚Äì3 target exchanges (e.g., Binance + Coinbase + Kraken).

Get API access

Create API keys (read + trade, disable withdrawals).

Verify API limits & WebSocket endpoints.

Set up core infra

Postgres + Prisma (for trades, configs, logs).

Redis (for orderbook cache + pub/sub).

Repo + CI/CD (GitHub Actions + Docker).

Monitoring baseline: Prometheus + Grafana, Sentry.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Project skeleton with DB + Redis connected.

Phase 2: Market Data Pipeline

Implement WebSocket clients

Subscribe to order book updates from both exchanges.

Rebuild and maintain local order books (top-of-book + depth).

Normalize data schema

Store prices in a consistent format (symbol, bid, ask, exchange).

Timestamp everything in UTC.

Add REST fallback

Periodically fetch order book snapshots in case WS drops.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Real-time feed of best bid/ask across exchanges in Redis.

Phase 3: Opportunity Detection

Spread calculator

Continuously check (SellPrice - BuyPrice) - Fees.

Include taker fees from both exchanges.

Add configurable slippage buffer.

Opportunity logger

Save detected opportunities (with spread %, fees, theoretical profit).

Store in Postgres for later analysis.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Bot can identify arbitrage spreads (logged but not executed).

Phase 4: Backtesting & Simulation

Replay historical data

Use recorded order books to test detection logic.

Paper trading mode

Execute ‚Äúvirtual trades‚Äù using live data.

Track simulated balances & PnL.

Analytics dashboard

Grafana/React UI to visualize opportunities & paper-trade results.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Simulated PnL reports proving strategy works on paper.

Phase 5: Execution Engine

Order Manager

Place simultaneous buy/sell orders via exchange APIs (start small size).

Track fills, retries, cancellations.

Handle partial fills (hedge leftover).

Risk Manager

Enforce position limits.

Daily stop-loss / max exposure caps.

Kill-switch (manual + automatic).

Balance tracker

Periodically sync balances from all exchanges.

Persist in Postgres for accounting.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Bot executes small live trades with strict limits.

Phase 6: Monitoring & Reliability

Metrics & Alerts

Trade latency, order success %, failed orders, API disconnects.

PnL tracking per day, per exchange.

Alerts to Slack/Telegram.

Error handling

Reconnect logic for dropped WebSockets.

Retry failed REST calls with exponential backoff.

Audit logs

Store all trade decisions for debugging & tax.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Production-ready bot that can run 24/7 without babysitting.

Phase 7: Scale & Optimization

Capital management

Improve balance allocation across exchanges.

Add automatic rebalancing logic.

Performance tuning

Optimize detection pipeline (Rust/Go microservices if needed).

Deploy servers in exchange‚Äôs closest region (e.g., AWS Tokyo for Binance).

Strategy expansion

Add triangular arbitrage inside one exchange.

Later explore cross-chain opportunities.

‚úÖ Deliverable: Profitable, robust system that can expand into more advanced strategies.
